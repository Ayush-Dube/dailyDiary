- working with git and gitignore
    - observe that git init command in terminal creates a .git folder (hidden),which confirms git has intialised here
    - now make a .gitignore file and inside mention the path and file format ,use wildcards.
---      
- Keep your repos clean with .gitignore.
- Use git add -f to include ignored files only when necessary.
- For bigger projects, structure .gitignore by language and file type.
---

- Noticed extra files (`.class`, `.out`) being pushed ‚Äî these are **compiled files**, not needed in the repo.
- touch a gitignore file and add the paths or file extensions to be ignored.

        Pattern	Effect
        *.class	-->Ignores .class files only in the current folder
        **/*.class -->Ignores .class files in all folders and subfolders
---
-  Only if u want ,Remove Already Tracked Compiled Files

        git rm --cached *.class
        git rm --cached *.out
        git commit -m "Removed compiled files and added .gitignore"
        git push
---
- If Ignored Files Are Needed Later

        git add -f MyProgram.class
        git commit -m "Added MyProgram.class for debugging"
        git push

    To remove it again:

        git rm --cached MyProgram.class

- Measure-Command {} - in Windows  
  - `java HelloWorld; Measure-Command { java HelloWorld > $null }  `
  - ‚úÖ Does redirecting to $null / Out-Null affect timing?  
     Short answer:    
    üëâ Thoda sa, haan ‚Äî lekin usually negligible
    Detailed answer below üëá      

        üîç Why could it affect timing?
        When you run:

       
        Measure-Command { java HelloWorld }
        The Java process runs

        Its output is sent to the console

        Console I/O (writing to the screen) takes a small but real amount of time
        (especially if output is large or if the terminal is slow)

        When you do:

       
        Measure-Command { java HelloWorld | Out-Null }
        or       
        Measure-Command { java HelloWorld > $null }
        The Java process runs the same

        But its output is discarded immediately

        No time wasted printing to console
        (output stream gets redirected and discarded in memory)

        ‚û°Ô∏è This saves a tiny bit of time ‚Äî typically milliseconds unless:

        The program prints a lot

        The console is slow

        Or the system is under heavy load

- Say your program takes 2.000 seconds to compute + 0.100 seconds to print 

    Measure-Command { java HelloWorld }
    ‚Üí 2.100 sec

    Measure-Command { java HelloWorld | Out-Null }
    ‚Üí 2.000 sec

    So ‚Äî yes ‚Äî output handling is part of the total execution time unless discarded.

- "Java" is not equal to "java" or "Java "    
 (extra spaces and capitalization matter because Java strings are case-sensitive).  
- can write int straight away `System.out.println(75);`
- "s", "9", "text" are examples of strings (represented by double quotes)  
- 's', '9', '+' are examples of characters (represented by single quotes) 
- A variable acts as a container for storing data that you can use and modify throughout your program.

        ‚úÖ Option 1: Run from PowerShell manually
        Open PowerShell (Win + S ‚Üí search "PowerShell" ‚Üí Run as Administrator)

        Type this and hit Enter:

        powershell
        Copy
        Edit
        powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "E:\mycmmd\createFile.ps1"
        ‚úÖ Option 2: Run via .bat file (double-click method)
        Make a run.bat file with this line:

        bat
        Copy
        Edit
        powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "E:\mycmmd\createFile.ps1"
        Then just double-click the run.bat file.
    ---
        ‚úÖ Step 1: Create PowerShell script
        Open Notepad

        Paste this inside:

        powershell
        
        $time = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss"
        $filepath = "E:\mycmmd\impText$time.txt"
        "i was created at $time" | Out-File -FilePath $filepath
        Save it as:

        makefile
        
        E:\mycmmd\createFile.ps1
        ‚úÖ Script ready.

        ‚úÖ Step 2: Create .bat file to run this script
        Open Notepad

        Paste this inside:

        bat
        
        powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "E:\mycmmd\createFile.ps1"
        pause
        Save it as:

        makefile
        
        E:\mycmmd\runScript.bat
        Make sure to select "Save as type: All Files", not .txt.

        ‚úÖ Double-click setup ready.

        ‚úÖ Step 3: Run and Test
        Now just double-click runScript.bat

        Ek CMD window khulega, aur file create hogi like:

        
        impText20250424_1945.txt
        File ke andar:

       
        i was created at 20250424_1945

    ---
        üîç Why this extra process is needed?
        By default:

        Windows doesn‚Äôt run .ps1 scripts on double-click

        It opens them in Notepad, or does nothing, because of security reasons

        That‚Äôs why we use .bat as a launcher

- Use Task Scheduler --> create task-->highest privlege-->trigger time

- cmd   

        üîß Steps for CMD Automation:
        Open Command Prompt (CMD) as Administrator (right-click and "Run as Administrator")

        Run this command to create a task that runs your PowerShell script every 5 minutes:

        
        SCHTASKS /CREATE /SC MINUTE /MO 5 /TN "CreateFileTask" /TR "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File E:\mycmmd\createFile.ps1" /F   

        /SC MINUTE: Task runs every minute.

        /MO 5: Every 5 minutes.

        /TN "CreateFileTask": Task name.

        /TR: Specifies the program/command to run.

        /F: Forces the task to be created (overwrites if exists).

-  To disable this automation

- Windows Task Scheduler minimum frequency is 1 minute ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt support every 30 seconds natively.

- ‚úÖ To directly run a .ps1 file (without .bat), you need to do this:
Option 1: Run from PowerShell manually    
 - powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "E:\mycmmd\createFile.ps1"

- ‚úÖ Safer & Better Option: .bat wrapper (just like you did)  

    The .bat file acts like a secure button:

    You control what it runs

    You can double-click it safely

    You can log, add pause, etc.
