2. install winSCP for connecting linux and my windows pc.
3. in order to use winSCP,u have to make the linux server login as password based rather than key based.

        ðŸ”¹key-based authentication
        ðŸ”¹password based authentication
        ðŸ”¹paswordLess authentication(bcoz key-pair already placed)
4. Presently not able to conect winSCP and a linux instance using keybased authentication.  
   
        - for now make the instance login as Password based.
        - then try winSCP login.

        fix
        - use public ip to login 
        - new issue, no access as root user ,therfore permission denid to copy files.

5. can u have multiples keys for the same server , for login auth.
