1. snippet for repeating code in vs code 
2. what is the use of `$uri` ?
3. what does `*` do in `/path//*.xyz`     

    

4. nginx 'rewrite' and 'alias'  
    -  alias goes to the actual location and servers a file. no url change. 
    -  while rewitre just changes the url.      
    -  it depends on the correct url. u may or may not change the url visibilty.

5.  Using Block. 
          
         - skip one whole line.  
         - and 4 tab space.
         - covers whole width of the screen.
         - can not use bullet points.
        ðŸ”¹ use this emoji instead of bullet points

1. ideas for test webpages and use them as docker test images.  

2. `access.log -> /dev/stdout`  
    its a symbolic link 

3. using `achor tag and href `inside the index.html page on a ec2 nginx server for routing, within a folder.
4. `href` vs `src`    
5. Git repo creation problem fixed.
  
       fix1  
       ðŸ”¹make folder in pc and a repo in github  
       ðŸ”¹get the repo url ,open gitbash in pcfolder,git init
       ðŸ”¹add . ; commit ; remote add origin ; push orgin 
       ðŸ”¹make sure the branch is main, incase use git checkout -b main   

       fix2
       ðŸ”¹ make a repo on github , add readme , commit 
       ðŸ”¹ go to the desired pcfolder where u want to have the pulled repo files.
       ðŸ”¹ git pull repo url ,now u r at par with the remote repo

### âš¡oct5
1. making a single page test webpage with css and javascript within the html file.  
2. install winSCP for connecting linux and my windows pc.
3. in order to use winSCP,u have to make the linux server login as password based rather than key based.

        ðŸ”¹key-based authentication
        ðŸ”¹password based authentication
        ðŸ”¹paswordLess authentication(bcoz key-pair already placed)  
        
        âœ¨pasword based linux server.
         - go to oct6
         




4. Presently not able to conect winSCP and a linux instance using keybased authentication.  
   
        - for now make the instance login as Password based.
        - then try winSCP login.

        fix
        - use public ip to login 
        - new issue, no access as root user ,therfore permission denid to copy files.

        problem : permissin denied
        fix:
        - just copy in respect user folder; move it later to other user;  
         give required permission to that user

5. can u have multiples keys for the same server , for login auth.
6. changing url of github repo.

        ðŸ”» if the github repo is renamed. 
        ðŸ”» git remote -v
        ðŸ”» git remote set-url origin <new-repo-url>


7. the permission is being denied because u are tring to opearte as a  different user  

    - just copy the files  as the existing usr in winSCP
    - from ur linux machine copy/move the files to the other desired user
    - provide permission if any error  
       - give chmod 777 /to/dir  
       - give chmod to files 
    - if u want u can revoke the permission later ,but this can cause problem if it is used as a webserver files  
      beacause the web request will be deined .   

     u can acheive desire objective like this...
