>Two seperate class with their own main() method inside, each having some variables inside the main method.
- would they able to use each others datamembers?? 
- `no`

⁉️- for questions that come to my 🧠

#### Java vs C Executable Files (Platform Independence)
- C code compiled on Windows creates a .exe file (Windows only).
- C code compiled on Linux creates a Linux binary (Linux only).
- These executables are not interchangeable between OSes.
- Java code compiles to bytecode (.class/.jar), not native OS executables.
- The same Java bytecode runs on any OS with a JVM (Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.).
- JVM makes Java platform independent; C executables are platform dependent.

🖥️ C Language (Platform Dependent)  
C code is compiled by a compiler into machine-specific executable code.  

The compiler converts the code into a .exe or binary based on the OS and architecture.  

📌 Example:  
- On Windows → winCode.exe
- On Linux → linCode (no .exe, just binary)  

✅ Each OS needs separate compilation.  
🚫 You cannot run Windows executable on Linux, or vice versa.  

☕ Java Language (Platform Independent at bytecode level)  
Java code is compiled by the Java Compiler (javac) into bytecode (.class file).  

This bytecode is not tied to any specific OS.  

It runs using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which acts as a bridge between OS and bytecode.  

📌 Example:  
MyProgram.java → Compiled to → MyProgram.class  

This .class file can run on:  

Windows JVM  

Linux JVM  

Mac JVM (or any other OS with JVM)  

✅ Write once, run anywhere (as long as JVM is installed)  
🚫 But .class is not a standalone executable like .exe; it needs JVM to run.

⁉️ 
- why do we even use local variable in java (inside method)?
- in java how does pointer work , what is commom between ref variable and object itself.?
- /n at end or start?
🟢 Best Practice    

|Use case|Recommended|
|---|---|
|Normal line output|Use \n at end only |
|Visually separate outputs|Use \n at start or both |
