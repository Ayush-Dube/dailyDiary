- i am struggling with grid a little bit , grid col i can handle(using minmax and auto-fit) but how to deal with rows, that i dont know 
- rows are not easy to predit , i guess i have to fix a definite size for them
- the solution is `grid-auto-rows: 350px` this makes new cards evrytime with 350px tall
