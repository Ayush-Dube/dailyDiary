      <summary>mysql ouput to a file</summary>     

        ðŸ”¹In the command echo "SHOW TABLES;" | mysql -u root -p mysql > ~/project/  system_tables.txt, the execution order is as follows:  
        
        - echo "SHOW TABLES;" runs first, generating the string SHOW TABLES; to be sent through the pipe.
        
        - The pipe (|) takes the output from echo and sends it as input to the MySQL client.
        
        - The MySQL command (mysql -u root -p mysql) runs concurrently with echo, waiting for input while prompting for a password due to the -p option.
        
        - Output redirection (> ~/project/system_tables.txt) occurs after the MySQL command executes, saving the results of SHOW TABLES; to the specified file.
        
        This sequence illustrates how piped commands execute in parallel, with the first command producing output that feeds into the second command.

        ðŸ”¹2nd Approach
            ðŸ‘‰ mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW TABLES;" mysql > ~/project/system_tables.txt   

            - Replace root with your MySQL root username (if different).
            - Enter the password when prompted.
            - The -e flag allows you to execute SQL statements directly from the command line.   

            - The mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW TABLES;" part executes the SQL command SHOW TABLES;.
            - By adding mysql after the SQL command, we specify the database (in this case, the mysql system database) where the SHOW TABLES; command should be executed.

            - If you donâ€™t specify the database, MySQL wonâ€™t know where to execute the SHOW TABLES; command, and you'll get an error like: NO database selected

            ðŸ”¹If the database is named test_DB, you simply replace mysql with test_DB   

                mysql -u root -p -e "SHOW TABLES;" test_DB > ~/project/system_tables.txt  

            ðŸ”¹If you want to copy the contents of the maintable from the database test_DB to a file table.txt  
            ðŸ‘‡  
            mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT * FROM maintable;" test_DB > ~/project/table.txt

            Explanation:
            mysql -u root -p: Connects to MySQL as the root user.
            -e "SELECT * FROM maintable;": Executes the SQL query to select all rows and columns from the table maintable.
            test_DB: Specifies the database where maintable resides.
            >~/project/table.txt: Redirects the output of the query to the file table.txt in the 
             ~/project directory.

             ~ represents the home directory for that user , its value is different for different users.

             Notes:
                ðŸ”»If the table has many rows or complex data, the output in table.txt might include column headers and data in a tab-separated format.

                ðŸ”»For custom formatting, you might need to tweak the SQL query or use additional tools like awk or sed.

- `Ctrl + L` to clear mysql terminal/command line 
- import in Pyhton
    - import sideMDL  
      - sideMDL.method1()  
      - sideMDL.method2() 
    - from sideMDL import method1,metho2
    - from sideMDL import *
    - after import sideMDL, if unsure about existing methods do `dir(sideMDL)`
    - from sideMDL import method1 as m1, method2 as m2  

        m1()   
        m2()
    
- `if __name__ == '__main__'`   write this in the moduleFile, code after this line will not run   
   in the hero file (i.e main file).

- Virtual Environment in python 
    - seperate independent environment having different versions os softwares.  
      `python -m venv anyName`  
      for activating the env   
      windows 
      `anyName\Scripts\activate.bat` -cmd 
      `anyName\Scripts\Activate.ps1` -powershell, but give Execution policy  
      linux  
      `source anyName/bin/activate`
    - `echo %PATH%`
    -  `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
    - give this txt file to fellow developer and they can install it   
      `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - mysql is a software like python. not a package
    - mainly for managing pip packages .
    - inside a new env if u do `pip list ` it should be empty.
    - for powershell and vscode terminal remember to give Execution Policy.
    - `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process` this allows to operator for current session, if u close the window it will reset to default.
    - in some cases the virtual module itself might be outdated ,mainly in linux  
      in that case do `sudo apt update` then install the `python virtualenv ` itself   
      then do , the venv cmd for creating virtual enviornment.

      In this lab, you have explored two fundamental concepts in Python programming: functions and modules. You have learned how to define and use functions, understand function scope, create and use modules, import specific functions from modules, and organize related modules into packages.

    You started by creating simple functions and gradually moved to more complex concepts like function scope and global variables. You then learned how to create modules to organize related functions and variables into separate files, making your code more maintainable and reusable.

    You explored different ways of importing functions from modules, including importing specific functions and using aliases. This knowledge allows you to write more concise and readable code while avoiding naming conflicts between different modules.

    Finally, you learned how to create a package, which is a way to organize related modules into a directory hierarchy. This is particularly useful for larger projects where you need to manage multiple related modules.

    These concepts of functions and modules are crucial for writing well-organized, efficient, and reusable Python code. As you continue your Python journey, you'll find these skills essential for building more complex programs and collaborating on larger projects. Remember to practice these concepts regularly and explore the vast ecosystem of Python modules and packages available to enhance your programming capabilities
